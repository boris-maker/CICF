# Framing the Program

Think of the program not as **attacking institutions**, but as:

> Making institutions experience the aesthetic, symbolic, and procedural logic of cyber-attacks.

The art is:

- the **threat model**
- the **interface**
- the **economy behind**
- the **spectacle of vulnerability**
- the **ritualization of cyber violence as cultural assets**

# Speculative Structure of the Performance

## 1. META Ransomware & The Hijack Environment

You build a **parallel internet experience**.

You create bait for users attempting to access a [FAMOUS MUSEUM] website.  
Instead, they land on a high-fidelity mirrored simulation — a theatre of cyber-attack.

Rather than attacking real sites, you create:

- High-fidelity clones/mirrors of cultural institutions’ public narratives.

Inside the simulation:

- Pages “lock” to simulate stress.
- Institutional language becomes scrambled or redacted.
- Timers count down to nothing.
- Fake data leaks appear.
- Manifestos replace curatorial text.
- Institutional authority dissolves into aesthetic instability.

- [Cybercrime as a Service — Nordstellar](https://nordstellar.com/blog/cybercrime-as-a-service/)

## 2. Mercado Central: Art-World Darknet Interface

A speculative art marketplace adopting the aesthetic of a deep-web black market.

The platform visually resembles an illegal marketplace —  
but trades in:

- Institutional vulnerabilities
- Curatorial contradictions
- Governance failures
- Conceptual exploits

This is:

> Crime-as-a-Service reinterpreted as Art-as-a-Service.

# Bounty Logic

Inspired by bug bounty ecosystems.

We create opportunities structured like exploit challenges.

Example format:

> “Take down the symbolic architecture of XXXXX institution.”

Participants:

- Propose speculative exploits.
- Identify structural weaknesses.
- Perform simulations.
- Submit conceptual breach documentation.

Rewards may include:

- Crypto (for art production)
- Artwork
- Public recognition
- Exhibition participation
- Archival inclusion

This mirrors bug bounty culture without replicating exploitation mechanics.

Context:

- [Bug Bounty Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program)  
- [Denial-of-Service Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)

Draft operational labels:

- BOYCOTTWARE™
- Code Pasta
- Ironic DDOS Attack
- Speculative Exploits

# Open Call for Collaborators

We invite:

- Security researchers  
- Deep web researchers  
- Artists  
- Curators  
- Designers  
- Engineers  
- Theorists  
- Philosophers  

To:

- Expose structural vulnerabilities
- Write speculative exploit papers
- Design fake malware UX
- Produce institutional “attack diagrams”
- Map power flows
- Simulate cascade failures

This echoes:

- Penetration testing
- Institutional critique
- Internet dramaturgy
- Critical code studies

---

# Exhibition / Output Formats

- Live website exhibitions (DeepWeb Gallery nodes)
- Projection of “locked” pages in physical spaces
- Screens with non-resolving countdowns
- Printed ransom notes as wall text
- IoT/low-fi public interventions
- Flash exhibitions (city / nature)
- Archive of operations
- Editorial releases

---

# Precedents

Operating in the lineage of:

- Institutional critique
- Net.art
- Hacktivism as performance
- Post-AI epistemics
- Simulation theory

---

# Ethical Position

a. The work is about violence, not violent.  
b. It stages symbolic systems, not real-world harm.  
c. It exposes fragility as aesthetic condition.

# Status

CICFA is a live research-performance framework.  
It evolves as institutions evolve.  
It mirrors the fragility of digital authority.

## Framing the Program

Think of the program not as **attacking institutions**, but as:

> Making institutions experience the aesthetic, symbolic, and procedural logic of cyber-attacks.
> 

The art is:

- the **threat model**
- the **interface**
- the **economy behind**
- the **spectacle of vulnerability**
- the **ritualization of cyber violence as cultural assets**

## Speculative Structure of the performance

[as examples]

### 1. META **Ransomware and the Hijack Environment**

You build a **parallel internet** **experience.
Y**ou create bait for people who wants to acces to [FAMOUS MUSEUM] website. 
End up accessing to a “similar site” with corrupted information— a *theatre of cyber-attack*.

→ Instead of attacking real sites, you create:

- High-fidelity **clones/mirrors** of cultural institution's public narrative.

→ What could happen inside the simulation:

- Pages “lock” creating you a stress ascieted with the “original institution” ( the war is spiritual )
- Content is replaced with extreme manifestos
- Timers count down to nothing
- Fake data leaks appear elevant agents in the targeted industryabout r
- Institutional language is scrambled or redacted

### 2.  Mercado **Central: an Art-World Darknet Interface**

Art Market Place that adopts the aethetic experience of a dark market on the deep web.

You create a website that *looks* like an illegal marketplace of subtances, private data, or edgier stuff. 

→ what could happen

**art-market online platform, larping as a darkweb market**. 

crime as a service identified with art market onlne feelings

- **Phishing emails.** Automated kits send personalized phishing emails to mount targeted attacks on victims. Emails persuade victims to download infected attachments, provide login credentials via fake websites, or take other risky actions.
- **Malvertising.** CaaS kits deploy fake ads that are infected with malicious software. Malware spreads as users visit websites hosting the ads, enabling secondary data theft or ransomware attacks.

### B. **Bounty Logic**

**Bug Bounty Programs Inspired**

We create a website to host the Bountys

We create the “oportunity/offer”. Exmple: Take down the website of XXXXX art institution.
Hackers can go for it. And if they succed, the system automatically send them the incetive/REWARD. 

“Here we dont do the hacking, we offer the opportunity to cybersecurity saavy experts to show the vulrability of an specific online system that represnts X institution.”

Considered as ( draft) :

- BOYCOTTWARE™
- Code Pasta
- Ironic DDOS Attack
- Speculative Exploits

Rewards can be:

- Crypto (for art production, not hacking)
- Art
- Public recognition
- Participation in the exhibition/archive

This mirrors bug bounties **without exploitation**.

### OPEN CALL FOR COLLABS

We invite:

- Security and DeepWeb Researchers
- Artists
- Curators
- Designers
- Theorists
- Engineers
- Religious people in general
- Extremists of any kind

For:

- Expose *structural* vulnerabilities
- Write speculative exploit research papers
- Design fake malware UX
- Produce “attack diagrams” of institutions as an art form
- Map power flows

This echoes:

- penetration testing
- ~~institutional critique warfare~~
- internet dramaturgy
- more >>>

## Exhibition / Output formats

- Website Exhibitions in our online gallery on the DeepWeb (live, evolving)
- Projection of “locked” pages in physical gallery space
- Screens showing countdowns in random places
- Printed ransom notes as wall text or public intervetions with IOT/lowfi instalations
- Flash Exhib ~ city / streets [register + report ]
- Flash Exhib ~Wild Nature [ register + report ]
- Archive of “operations”
- Editorial Public Releases

---

## Precedents (conceptual lineage)

You’re operating in the lineage of:

- institutional critique
- net.art
- hacktivism as performance
- post-AI epistemics
- simulation theory

### Ethical disclosure

a. The work is **about violence**, not violent.

b. Learn more about Far Tekno.
